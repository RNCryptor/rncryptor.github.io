RNCryptor has a new home of sorts. It now lives it its own organization, and I've split all the implementations into their own repositories. There's a new [RNCryptor-Spec](https://github.com/RNCryptor/RNCryptor-Spec) repository to track the specification itself. And there's this nice, new website to make things a little easier to find. I hope it helps you find what you need. I expect a lot of work on RNCryptor in 2014.
